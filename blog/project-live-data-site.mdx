The internet can be a weird place. I first started this site as a homage to the pointless information we tell people on social media. I had the idea to track meaningless data: steps per day, recent music, last food-related transaction. I wanted this site to be a playful dig on social media, and a unique way to have a presence on the internet that is different from traditional personal sites.

I also designed this form for an email sign-up.
