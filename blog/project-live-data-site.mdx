The internet can be a weird place. I first started this site as an homage to the sometimes pointless information we tell people on social media on the internet. I had the idea to track meaningless data like steps per day, recent music, and the last food-related transaction. I wanted this site to be a playful dig on social media, and a unique way to have a presence on the internet that is different from traditional personal sites.
