Omni is a service that lets you store and rent out your items. Their marketplace helps cut down on storage space and will deliver items to your door. 

Omni wanted to create experiences that target users in the cities they live. I created a series of landing page templates to give users ideas of “experiences” they can have with Omni with items that are available to rent near them!
