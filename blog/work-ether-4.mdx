At The Scenery, we built design systems for enterprise applications and even marketing sites. We were so familiar with them we build our base design system that included core elements of every system weâ€™d ever built. This system, Ether, created modular libraries so production was faster and easier for teams.

Sharing this system with the public was the natural thing to do, we just needed a way to talk about it!

Using the core building blocks of ether, we established the core libraries of type, spacing, and color.

We created the Ether brand inspired by natural elements in the world because we felt this system was as natural to design as the world around us. All designers start with the core elements of color, type, and space.

To spread the word, we sent out a promotional email to our current subscribers. After a teaser landing page garnered more attention, I designed a campaign that marked the launch of Ether and blasts that notified subscribers of libraries as they were released.
