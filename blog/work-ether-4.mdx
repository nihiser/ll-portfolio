At The Scenery, we built design systems for enterprise applications and marketing sites. We were so familiar with them, but we found ourselves building the same system over and over. Enter Ether: the design system for our team that included the core elements from every system we’d built. 

To learn more about the work The Scenery did on those systems, see these posts: [Space](https://ether.thescenery.co/spacing/), [Color](https://ether.thescenery.co/color/), [Type](https://ether.thescenery.co/typography/). 

After working so hard on this system, it made sense to share it. I created [ether.thescenery.co](https://ether.thescenery.co) to help promote our thoughtful work!

We used the core building blocks of Ether to build this site.

For the Ether brand, I took inspiration from natural elements in the world because I felt this system was as natural to design as the world around us. After all, every designer starts with the core elements of color, type, and space!

To spread the word, we sent out a promotional email to our current subscribers. I also designed a campaign that marked the launch of Ether and email blasts that notified subscribers of libraries as they were released.
