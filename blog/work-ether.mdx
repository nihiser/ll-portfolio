At The Scenery, we built designs systems for enterprise applications and even marketing sites. We were so familiar with them we build our own base design system that included core elements of every system we’d ever built. This system, Ether, created modular libraries so production was faster and easier for teams.

Ether is built on a set of small core libraries. Their simplicity belies the fact that they are the outcome of years of building design systems across projects that range from marketing sites to enterprise applications. These libraries won’t try to do everything. They try to do the right thing.

Using the core building blocks of ether, we established the core libraries of type, spacing, and color.
