Lyra Health provides comprehensive mental health care by providing thoughtful coaching programs that work. They came to our team because they knew what we did best: empathetic and communicative design work.



(onboarding webbing)

Lyra Health’s care platform is built to help you succeed. They onboard users by asking a series of compelling questions and match the user to the correct care. The problem was that users were not trusting the results from this ‘quiz’. Our job was to rethink this treatment flow and build trust to guide the user to a result they both expect and feel is right.



(wireframes)

We wireframed out possible solutions that gave the user affirmation for their primary need and a layout that introduced them to their solution.



The final design clearly showed the user Lyra’s opinionated care solution. The design informs them what this looks like in real quantifiable terms and guides them to the next step.
