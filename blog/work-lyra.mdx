Lyra Health provides comprehensive mental health care via thoughtful coaching programs that work. To get users on the right track, Lyra onboards users by asking a series of diagnostic questions and matching the user to the correct care. 

There were a few problems with the previous flow. 

The Lyra care providers disliked how un-opinionated the previous flow was. They wanted to confidently direct users to a selected path forward. The previous flow gave users a round of questions, and then showed the three care options with a small annotation on the care option the quiz had picked for them. 

Additionally, user feedback showed that the onboarding flow was too simple and users did not trust the results of the quiz.

In the wireframe phase, we created a flow idea (1) that strongly suggested one of the Lyra Care options for the client. To build trust (2), we played with the idea of adding more information on the marketing site to inform the user of the Care Options upfront. We also added more information about the types of treatments on the results page (3).

Because users felt so disconnected with the flow, we wanted to focus on the biggest issue they were facing. By identifying this primary need, we could make them feel heard and direct them to the right care. We put this into use by asking users questions to determine their primary need, and then provide confirmation of the need in a dialog box before the results page (image number).

Because the “primary need’ option might not fit every client’s experience, we also created an option that reassures users with “normalizing statements”. If a client selected that they often felt nervous, the flow would normalize their feelings: “everyone is anxious sometimes, but when things get hard to manage, we could all use a helping hand.” In this way, the flow eliminated the need for one primary issue, allowing the user to focus on multiple concerns.

The final quiz results page shows a much more opinionated response. Users are directed to start with the approach that best fits them. The other care options are still a click away without distracting the user from Lyra’s pick.
