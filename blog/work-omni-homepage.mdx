Omni is a service that lets you store and rent out your items. Their marketplace helps cut down on storage space and will deliver items to your door. 

Omni needed a marketing site that would fit their growing product and show off their rentable items. The site I created clearly explains Omniâ€™s purpose in the first fold and then encourages users to jump into the product to try it out. Also, the site is templated and uses Ether, a design system, to make it simple for the growing team to edit the site as they see fit. I worked with a wonderful illustrator creating images that show people using Omni. I loved the sketch so much that I included it here. See the final version on [Omni.co](omni.co)!
