When it’s time to put a pool in your backyard, it’s hard to visualize what it would look like in your space. Because I hail from rainy/snowy/temperamental Dayton Ohio, I’d never been presented with The Pool Conundrum. It’s often hard to see all your options when considering building. Contractors will quote a client based on their own capabilities, but they often specialize in a specific style. The folks at Pool Orchard wanted to solve this problem.



Pool Orchard came to me needing an MVP to show off their idea. They wanted a small brand refresh, web-app overhaul, and design system. And quickly.

With some quick collaboration, I created a whimsical wordmark and logo that’s optimized for use in the web app. Taking cues from editorial simplicity, I focused on making the pool concept easily identifiable at a small size.

During the design process, the search page became my biggest focus. It is here that users get their first impression of Pool Orchard. 

The pool itself is the main focus of the listing. Heirarchy of pool, name, cost, contractor. Originally, the listing included many unnecessary info that I eliminated to focus on what users are looking for.

The biggest change for the listing page was the “pool size counter”. Its easier for contractors to quote for exact pool size, so I included an input for users to enter square footage.
