Tangram Flex helps engineers share complex capabilities between systems. I worked with them to create a new voice for their brand, marketing site, and promotional materials. This design work helped them secure their first round of funding.

Working with the shapes of a tangram, we went forward with a concept that morphs and moves shapes to symbolize Tangram's ability to systemize hardware & software.

While at The Scenery, designs systems followed me into marketing design. I worked with front-end developers extensively building a flexible system made up of individual reusable components that were easily maintained and responsibly grown.

The Tangram site itself aims to strike the right balance between formal and scientific. The minimal type system helps to balance abstract shapes.
